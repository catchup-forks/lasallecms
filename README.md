## NOTE

This is the flagship app for my LaSalle Software. 

## Summary

LaSalle Software is my Laravel 5.1 based web application software. 

LaSalle Software is comprised primarily of inter-related packages. This is the only app that I offer, whose sole purpose is to serve as our LaSalle-Laravel starting point. 

## Description

LaSalle Software is crafted with love and care for myself; and, for my clients.

LaSalle Software is Free Open Source Software. However, it is not an open source project. There is no commitment to bring online documentation to fruition, nor for other facets associated with running an open source project.
 
LaSalle Software makes custom web applications economically accessible to clients who would otherwise turn to Joomla or WordPress (my own specialties, which is why I mention 'em). We need to craft web applications, not build websites, for ourselves.

The Laravel Framework for PHP, version 5.1, is the hottest such framework out there. For all its tremendous technical achievements, L5.1 represents an economic achievement, bringing down the cost of undertaking web applications. 

However, getting from the superb Laravel Framework to your actual web application is a big leap. My LaSalle Software is this leap.
 
LaSalle Software, especially the LaSalle Content Management System, is offered as Free Open Source Software for the purpose of making the LaSalle-Laravel web application combination economically accessible. 

Caveat: sometimes, it won't be so feasible. We are still at the beginnings of this shift.
   
LaSalle Software: web app power, website prices.


## Straight Ahead Software
 
LaSalle Software is straight ahead software. No funny business. No proprietary crap. No weirdness to frustrate other devs.
 
Anyone who knows Laravel will understand my software (and will note the "LaraCast-y" influences).

## Administrative Form Automation
 
There is only one area that is unabashedly "Bob-ish": my administrative form automation. This area, properly so, is not addressed in the Framework. There are many ideas out there about streamlined ways to create administration forms. However, I need a version that fits my LaSalle Software. So I came up with my own innovation to address this need. 
 
Admin form automation represents an important economic feature. Without having to hand-craft the admin forms, we speed up "spinning up" web app packages.
