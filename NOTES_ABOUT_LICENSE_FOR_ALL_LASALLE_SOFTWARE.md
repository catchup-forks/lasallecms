I am putting these notes here, in one place, on my Flagship App, even though it applies to all my LaSalle Software packages. I don't want to edit twenty separate files every time I do an update. 

I am using the GPL license perhaps as a holdover of my experiences with Joomla. I've not seen anything that says that using an MIT framework in GPL software is b-a-d. I have not really dug into this issue either. 

I do believe in "giving back". 

I am the beneficiary of millions of dollars of Free Open Source Software (FOSS), as are you. Releasing LaSalle Software is my way of "giving back", because at minimum there is a pedagogical value to seeing how I use Laravel (so I think). Developing composer installable packages instead of "one big app" is an ongoing topic at the meet-ups. 
 
My perception/understanding of the MIT & GPL licenses: the MIT license lets you use the software without any regard to "giving back". The GPL licence does "make provisions" about "giving back". 

One of the articles below states that I should explicitly state the fact that "contributers must assign all rights to you in order to accept pull requests. So, let me state, without having a contributor agreement, for the sake of accepting Pull Requests -- and maybe that day will never come, maybe it will --  that CONTRIBUTORS ASSIGN ALL RIGHTS TO ME.  
 
If licensing issues come to the fore with LaSalle Software, which I doubt, I'll probably address those issues in my blog.
